# Tanish Kumar  
### Full-Stack Developer • MERN + TypeScript • Learning by Building

I learn software engineering by **building real things**,  
breaking them, fixing them, and understanding **why they work**.

## How I Got Here

I started as someone curious about how websites work.  
Over time, curiosity turned into habit.

I don’t just write features.  
I try to understand:
- how data flows  
- why systems fail  
- what happens when users grow  
- where code becomes hard to change  

Most of my learning comes from **projects**, not tutorials.

---

## How I Learn (My Way)

My learning loop is simple and repeatable:

Problem → Build → Break → Refactor → Learn → Apply again


1. Pick a real problem  
2. Build a working version  
3. Break it with edge cases  
4. Refactor the structure  
5. Read system design concepts  
6. Apply them back to the project  

That’s how things actually stick.

---

## What I Spend Time On Now

- Building **complete projects**, not demos  
- Writing backend APIs and tracing request → response  
- Handling async work (events, background jobs)  
- Using AI only where it clearly helps  
- Learning system design step by step (LLD → HLD)  
- Practicing DSA alongside development  

---

## What I Usually Work On

### Backend
- REST API design  
- Authentication and authorization  
- Async tasks and background jobs  
- Real-time systems (chat, video, sync)  
- Database schema and queries  

### Frontend
- React and Next.js apps  
- Reusable component structure  
- Loading, error, and edge states  
- Simple, usable UI  

### AI (Carefully)
- Calling LLM APIs  
- Turning text into structured output  
- Automating repetitive workflows  
- Avoiding AI where logic is enough  

### CS Fundamentals
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- OS, DBMS, CN, OOP  
- Studied alongside B.Tech and applied in projects

I learn by building.  
If something breaks, I fix it.  
If I don’t understand it, I go deeper.
